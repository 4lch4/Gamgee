# DWL.Helper
A PowerShellÂ module containing various functions that make my life easier.
I created the module using PowerShell Studio by SAPIEN Technologies, inc.

## Installation
In order to use this module, your machine requires PowerShell and the standard ssh.exe. I've only tested this with PowerShell 5.0/5.1 but it should work on 3.0+, no promises though!

If you clone or download the repo, it needs to be placed in **C:\Users\<User>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\DWL.Helper\**, then you should be able to open a new PowerShell console and run ``Get-Command -Module DWL.Helper`` and it list the available commands in the module.

## Uses
### NodeJS Projects
There are various functions in the TronCommands.ps1 file that help with managing the public Tron bot and a few privately hosted ones.
The functions help with:
- Uploading the latest version of specific builds.
- Starting the service for a specific user.
- Restarting the service for a specific user.
- Stopping the service for a specific user.
- Connecting to the server that hosts the various bots.
- Connecting to the beta server that I test new versions of the bots.

### Morty Pictures
The Get-MortyPictures.ps1 contains functions for retrieving the latest images available on https://pocketmortys.net.
These are primarily used as my avatars, since there's so many I'm able to change frequently while maintaining a universal identity.
The functions are used to:
- Get the front images available for each Morty in the game.
- Get the back images available for each Morty in the game.
- Get the sprites of each Morty in the game.
- Perform all of the above actions in sequence.

## Notes
In order to use the NodeJS functions, they all use the standard ssh.exe available when you install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in **C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin**.
If you haven't installed [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) then at least ensure ssh.exe is added to your system or user PATH.
